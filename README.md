# LetsMakeUsFamous
**Node.js Project developed by team SoftGuys**

## Project Description
The main purpose of our application is to travel. We have been inspired by people who love to travel to different destinations in our beatiful country Bulgaria and to collect stamps. However we believe that in 2017 this can happen much easier. In our app we have all 100 official Bulgarian landmarks and even some additional! In order to collect stamps you only need to login to our site whenever you visit some landmark and to upload photo of yourself. Our core algorithm will verify if you are trying to cheat or will upload succesfull if you are close to landmark. Hope you will enjoy your staying and will find many friends. Welcome to the Bulgaria's National Tourist Sites[version 1.0] Enjoy!
